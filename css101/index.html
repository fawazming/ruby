    <h1>Welcome to CSS 101</h1>
    <p>This is a simple example of CSS styling in action. With the typography and layout features of CSS, you can make your web pages look more visually appealing. Examples of typography include font styles, sizes, and colors. Layout features include positioning, margins, padding, and alignment.</p>
    <p>Font Styles like font-weight with values 100-900 - each getting thicker as the value increases, font-size with values like 12px, 16px, 24px, and font-family with values like Arial, Times New Roman, or Verdana also having family name like serif(with ears), sans-serif (modern without ears), monospace (fixed-width characters), cursive (script).</p>
    <p>
    Layout features include display properties like block, inline, and flexbox for arranging elements on the page. Margins (external space) and padding(internal space) help create space around and within elements, while alignment properties like text-align and vertical-align help position content appropriately.
