    <p>USB‑C, <i>or USB Type‑C</i>, is a 24-pin reversible connector (not a protocol) that supersedes all previous USB connectors, which were designated legacy in 2014. This connector also supersedes Mini DisplayPort and Lightning connectors.</p> 
        
    <p>USB-C is used for a variety of purposes: exchanging data with peripheral devices, such as external drives, mobile phones, keyboards, track-pads, and mice, or between hosts, or transferring A/V-data to displays and speakers, or also powering peripheral devices and getting powered by power adapters; either through directly wired connectors, or indirectly via hubs and docking stations.

    <p>This connector type can be used for other data transfer protocols besides USB, such as Thunderbolt, PCIe, DisplayPort, and HDMI. It is considered extensible, allowing the support of future protocols.</p>
